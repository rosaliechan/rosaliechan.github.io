    <h1>About Me</h1>
   	<h3 style="position:relative; bottom:80px">Hello!  My name is Rosalie Chan, and I am a journalism and computer science student at Northwestern University.  I have been involved in journalism since high school and have written, edited and produced multimedia content for various publications.  I am especially interested in the intersection of journalism and technology, notably online, multimedia and interactive journalism.  My goals include learning more about computer science and how to tell stories in more dynamic ways.  I believe every person has a story, and I am especially interested in reporting on diversity, race, education, immigration, and Asian and Latino issues.
    In my free time, I experiment with photography and code.  I coded this website out of scratch, so feel free to <a href="mailto:rosaliechan2017@u.northwestern.edu" class="writinglist"><u>send me any comments or critiques</u></a>.  Other than that, I love cats, books, running, card games, updating my endless Spotify playlists and the city of Chicago.  You can view my resume <a href="resume.pdf" class="writinglist"><u>here</u></a>.</h3>
