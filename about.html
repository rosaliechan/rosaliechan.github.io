    <h1>About Me</h1>
   	<h3 style="position:relative; bottom:80px">Hi, I'm Rosalie.  I am a journalism and computer science student based in Chicago.  I am currently a sophomore at Northwestern University.  I am exploring multimedia, news writing and feature writing, as well as the intersection of journalism and technology.  I have written, edited and produced multimedia content for various publications, and in my free time, I experiment with photography, videography and coding.  I coded this website out of scratch, so feel free to <a href="mailto:rosaliechan2017@u.northwestern.edu">send me any comments or critiques</a>.  I believe every person has a story, and I am especially interested in reporting on diversity, race, education, immigration, and Asian and Latino issues. Other than that, I love reading, card games, running, my cats and updating my endless Spotify playlists.  You can view my resume <a href="resume1.pdf" style="color:#333399;">here</a>.</h3>
