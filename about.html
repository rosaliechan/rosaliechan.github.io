    <h1>About Me</h1>
   	<h3 style="position:relative; top:-75px">Hi, I'm Rosalie.  I am a journalism and computer science student based in Chicago.  I am currently a sophomore at Northwestern University.  I am especially interested in multimedia and writing news and features, as well as the intersection of journalism and technology.  I have written, edited and produced multimedia content for various publications, and in my free time, I experiment with photography, videography and coding.  Other than that, I love reading, card games, running, my cats and updating my endless Spotify playlists.  You can view my resume <a href="resume1.pdf" style="color:#333399;">here</a>.</h3>
