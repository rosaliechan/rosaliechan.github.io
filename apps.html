        <p>StoryLineJS is a storytelling line chart tool that I worked on for the Knight Lab.  I started working on the development of this tool in spring 2016.</p>  
                    <p>To start off, I conducted research on existing charting tools and stories that use line charts.  Next, I worked on sketching and prototyping how the tool would look and work.  I created paper prototypes and iteratively tested them.  Finally, I worked on a web prototype using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and d3.js.</p>
                    <p>The beta version of StorylineJS was <a href="https://storyline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">recently released</a>.</p>

    <p>For my Software Project Management and Development class, I worked on eRetirements with a group for a client.  Our client requested that we redesign the interface of the questionnaire of eRetirements, a website that recommends to users places to retire.</p>
         <p>We designed the interface so that the questionnaire would feel more personalized, as users can rate how important a category is to them when considering where to retire.  Furthermore, users can take answer questions in any order they wnt, and they can go back to previous questions, as answers are saved.  In order to appeal to middle-aged and elderly users, we worked on implementing an easy-to-use, user-friendly questionnaire.</p>
         <p>For this project, we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Check it out <a href="http://eecs394-s16.github.io/eRetirements/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>For my Software Project Management and Development class, I worked on GeoVibes with a group.  We came up with the idea for this iOS app ourselves.  The idea behind this app is, you can search a place, and this app will tell you where it is and what the "vibe" there currently is by giving you a positivity rating.  For example, Disney World always has a really positive vibe.</p>
                    <p>For this project, we used AppGyver, the Google Maps API, the Twitter API and a sentiment analysis API.  The app comes up with a positivity rating based on tweets about the searched location.</p>

              <p>In redesigning <a href="http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/wic/" target="_blank">WiC's website</a>, I used the concepts of material design and parallax design.  I also worked on making the website mobile-friendly.  I used trianglify.js for the website's background.</p>

                  <p>In February 2016, I attended HackIllinois, a hackathon hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  My group created <a href="http://rude.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Rude!</a>, an Android app that encourages you to spend quality time with your friends, rather than your phone.</p>
                  <p>To use this app, when you're with friends, you can switch your phone to "social mode."  You earn points for not touching your phone during the time you spend with friends, but if you touch your phone, you lose points, and your phone will give you a sassy message.  If you touch your phone three times, an embarassing Facebook status will be posted on your wall.</p>
                  <p>We used Android Studio to develop this app.  Ideally, the points would be used to redeem coupons and offers at local businesses.</p>
