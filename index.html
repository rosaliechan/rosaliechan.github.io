    <p>Hello! My name is Rosalie, and I am a journalism and computer science student at Northwestern University.  I'm especially interested in data storytelling, investigative journalism, reporting on race, product development and UX.  My work has been published in TIME, The Chicago Reporter, Narratively, Mochi Magazine, Jiemian News, the China Post, the Taipei Times and E The Magazine For Today's Female Executive.  </p>
        <p>Currently, I am a student fellow at <a href="http://knightlab.com/" target="_blank">Northwestern University's Knight Lab,</a> a lab that explores the innovation of journalism and technology and builds a community for students who want to learn more about code.  At the lab, I have conducted data analysis on Knight Lab products, as well as product research, iterative design and web development for new Knight Lab tools.</p>
    <p>I am also fluent in Mandarin Chinese.  I spent last summer in Taiwan conducting research on Hakka youth cultural identity, and I spent last fall in an intensive Chinese language program at Beijing Foreign Studies University. </p>
    <p>In my free time, I experiment with photography and code.  Other than that, I love cats, books, running, card games, newsletters, podcasts and the city of Chicago. Finally, I am a passionate advocate for diversity in media and tech, and I run a newsletter highlighting long form stories by women of color.

        <p>In June 2016, I presented at Northwestern's 2016 Undergraduate Research &amp; Arts Exposition.  I spoke about the research I conducted in Taiwan in summer 2015, where I interviewed dozens of youth and other people about the declining Hakka language and culture.  In this presentation, I explained the history of the Hakkas in Taiwan, why I conducted this research and the generation gap between the Hakka elderly and youth on Hakka language ability. </p>
                    <p>I also presented three case studies of people I interviewed: a recent college graduate who actively promotes the Hakka language on social media, a radio DJ who learned the Hakka language after college and now runs a Hakka language program, and a 90-year-old Hakka man who grew up during the Japanese occupation and wrote a Hakka dictionary after retiring from a long career in education.</p>

    <p>In Winter 2015, I took a course about computer graphics, where we created animated graphics using WebGL and OpenGL and explored three-dimensional shapes, movement, lighting and texture.  Based on the skills I learned in the course, I did research on how animated graphics are used in journalism and presented this talk at the Knight Lab's Open Lab, where students can gather to work on projects and learn to code.  </p>
        <p>In this talk, I showed examples of how animated graphics are used in journalism and WebGL projects.  I also explained how students can get started in learning how to create graphics by using canvas and HTML5.</p>

        <p>In spring 2016, I attended "Hack the Gender Gap: A Women's IoT Makeathon" at West Virginia University, along with two other Northwestern students.  At this Makeathon, which is hosted by MediaShift, we were presented with a challenge to come up with an idea for an Internet of Things product and design a business plan.</p>
                    <p>After returning from the Makeathon, we presented what we learned at Knight Lab's Open Lab.  We explained what the definition of the Internet of Things and talked about the projects we came up with.</p>

       <p>In February 2016, I created a newsletter that highlights long reads and multimedia work by women of color. I wanted to start a newsletter because 2016 has been named "the year of the newsletter," but more importantly, because the media industry lacks diversity, and women of color have fewer opportunities to take senior positions in the newsroom and write long-form features.  Because of this, I wanted to highlight the great work women of color are doing in the media industry.</p> 
    <p>At the Knight Lab's Open Lab, I gave this presentation on what I learned from starting a newsletter, For me, the biggest challenge is growth.  Currently, I promote my newsletter on four different social media channels.</p>

                    <p>In winter 2016, I took a course on human-computer interaction, where we had to prototype, user test and design an app that would increase civic engagement.</p>
        <p>My group came up with Foodo, an app that allows users to track their eating and grocery shopping habits and reduce food waste by figuring out how much food they should actually buy.  Furthermore, the user would have the option to donate the money they saved to an organization that addresses world hunger.</p>
        <p>In order to design this website, we had to brainstorm ideas, interview and observe people on their grocery shopping and eating habits, come up with representative tasks and create paper and web protoypes for this app.  Ideally, this app could target people of all ages who grocery shop for themselves or their families.</p>
